This repository presents an advanced approach to landslide prediction utilizing fuzzy logic, a powerful computational paradigm that excels in handling uncertainty and imprecision inherent in geological data. The system is meticulously crafted to provide accurate forecasts based on intricate fuzzy rules derived from in-depth analyses of landslide case studies documented in research papers (yet to be uploaded).

Dependencies:
Ensure all necessary modules are installed:

scikit-fuzzy (SKFUZZY) for fuzzy logic computations.
tkinter for the development of graphical user interfaces.
matplotlib for visualizing data and results.
Note:
It is imperative to acknowledge that the fuzzy rules employed in this repository are grounded in empirical evidence obtained from extensive research. However, the specific research papers serving as the foundation for these rules are pending upload.

Attention:
Please be aware that while the code provided in this repository offers significant insights into landslide prediction utilizing fuzzy logic, there may be discrepancies between the code and the graphical user interface (GUI).
